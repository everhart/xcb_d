# XCB_D

Autogenerated `libxcb` bindings for the D programming langauge.

## Dependencies

* dstep 1.0.4 or greater
* clang 14.0 or greater
* libxcb (any version)

## Building

To build, one first must set the `XCB_INCLUDE_DIR` environment variable to refer to where the libxcb headers are located. This is usually `/usr/include/xcb`, but it may differ on your system. Then, simply `cd` into the `build` directory and run `autogen.sh`.

```
git clone https://github.com/everheart/xcb_d
cd build
export XCB_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/xcb
sh autogen.sh
```

The bindings will be generated in `build/install`.

Alternatively, pre-generated bindings are available in this repository's `src` directory. However, due to version conflicts, it is best to generate them for the `libxcb` installation of your existing system.
